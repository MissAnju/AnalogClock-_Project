# AnalogClock-_Project

An analog clock is a traditional timekeeping device that displays time using a circular dial with numbered hours and rotating hands.
Typically, it has three hands: the hour hand, which is shorter and moves slowly; the minute hand, which is longer and moves faster; and often a thin second hand that moves the fastest.
The clock face features 12 numbers arranged in a circle, representing the hours of the  day.
Analog clocks can be powered by mechanical mechanisms or batteries, and they are commonly found in homes, offices, and public spaces. Their classic design makes them both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
